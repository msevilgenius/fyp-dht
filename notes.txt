in find successor when checking if id is between this node and successor
account for case when this node is the last node (i.e. has highest id of all nodes)
by:
if successor <= thisnode 
then 
    check thisnode-max and 0-successor
else
    check thisnode-successor
    
make function to compare nodes?
