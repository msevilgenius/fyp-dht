in find successor when checking if id is between this node and successor
account for case when this node is the last node (i.e. has highest id of all nodes)
by:
if successor <= thisnode 
then 
    check thisnode-max and 0-successor
else
    check thisnode-successor
    
make function to compare nodes?


net:

connections list

create (setup)
activate (actually connect)
close

get_read_buf(conn)
get_write_buf(conn)

set_read_cb(conn)
set_err/timeout_cb(conn)


setup:
    set listen socket, handler, arg
    
    handler should update read/event/arg/(write) for connection



pred request:
reply:
    OK
    id
    ip
    port
    
or
    NONE



a e.g. notify request msg body contains id and listen port not ip



node_send_msg ( msg, to_node, replycb, errcb )
    ->
    here's a message (msg), send it to to_node, reply goes to replycb, failure goes to errcb
    






for sending/routing to nodes:

net_connect (closest preceding node)



segfault on receiving connection

fix it by  moving most of what is in netw_incomming_cb to a new netw_incomming_read



instead of just setting watermark and new callback after parsing header, check if the required amount of data is already in the buffer and call the callback manually if necessary.
