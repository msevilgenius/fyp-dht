id -> ip:port map

netio:
    listen
      handle incoming -> dht
    sendmessage(node, message)

dht:
    node info:
    id
    finger table
    successor
    predecessor
    
    
    nodes stored in finger table?
    duplication
    or
    cached map of ids -> nodes, finger table stores ids
    
logging:
file/stdout?



protocol design:

dht:

find_successor:
req: find successor id
resp: successor [of id] is s_id
  --s_id needs actual address not just hash id

notify:
req: notify id
resp: [ok]

check_predecessor:
req: are you there
resp: yes i am here
